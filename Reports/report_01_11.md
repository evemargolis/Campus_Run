#  Report for the week of November 1st 2021

After discussions with the each member of team, we've separated ourselves in two different groups working on the design of the game and on the 'back' of the game, which we will assemble later.


# Teams:

### UI design 

Marie,Fiona, Antonina:
This week, our team did research on the graphics and on the libraries to use in general (particularly SFML for UI). We furthermore tried to deepen our understanding on how to develop a quality UI which would be appropriate for our game. Next week, depending on which resource we decide to use, we will further familiarize ourselves with how to use it to implement the graphics for the game.



### Game engine development
Antoine Babu, Antoine Majoie, Eve Margolis, Rojin Radmehr, Hassiba Tej: This week, we researched possible video games libraries (SFML, SDL, Unity, â€¦) and how basic movements and game mechanisms could be implemented in these. We also looked into how to add the possible libraries into QtCreator or VisualStudio Code, and looked at ideas for game dynamics already programmed by other C++ users. Next week, depending on what is approved we will start coding the fundamental motions to have a running game engine by the end of the week.
