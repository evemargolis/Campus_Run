#  Report for the week of November 8th 2021
After discussions with the each member of team, we've separated ourselves in two different groups working on the design of the game and on the 'back' of the game, which we will assemble later.

### Done this week :
This week, as a team, we ensured we had a running game engine which allowed us to move a pixelated cat forwards and backwards and which had the ability to jump. In addition, each member of our team 
began working on different and more specific aspect of the game. These included the coin class and coin counter, the basic menu user interfrace, the camera, rendering the player, hitbox and collisions, physics (making sure gravity works) and the platform and object classes.
