#  Report for the week of November 8th 2021
After discussions with the each member of team, we've separated ourselves in two different groups working on the design of the game and on the 'back' of the game, which we will assemble later.

Antoine Majoie:
This week I spent quite a bit of time to run the game (I'm on iOS and it was complicated to run SFML on Visual Studio, I ended up using my older laptop that runs on Windows). I was able to grasp a better understanding on the camera movement through research, but I have not implemented it yet. On the other hand, I added deceleration to the physics of the player, to regulate its movement.

Rojin Radmehr:

Made the class for obstacles and different types of platforms and the different interactions with them and their characteristics.
Next week i will complete this since i needed collision detection for some parts.
