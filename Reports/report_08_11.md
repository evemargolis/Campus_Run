#  Report for the week of November 8th 2021
After discussions with the each member of team, we've separated ourselves in two different groups working on the design of the game and on the 'back' of the game, which we will assemble later.

# Teams:

### UI design

Marie:




Fiona:




Antonina: This week, I spent most of my time figuring out how to run the game on Mac by using a Windows virtual machine (Virtual Box to be specific) to run Visual Studio Code. I worked with Fiona on rendering the player and I added animations to the player class. We will be able to reuse this function to render objects and enemies in the future.
