###UI design


Marie: This week, I worked on implementing continuous character motion for the CampusRun: The Run Section and player animation (i.e. what happens when the character encounters an object that kills them). Next week, I hope to be able to have this synced with the kill object class and complete build the maps for the 2 CR: TheRun Urban and Jungle maps.
