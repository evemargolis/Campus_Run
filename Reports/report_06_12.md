Antonina: This week, I had some issues with my computer as I was unable to run code since QT stopped working for me. I tried to fix this by reopening all our files from the beginning, but it still didn't work. I hope to ask the TAs for help with this on Thursday so I am able to run code before break. Otherwise, I worked some more on player interactions with an object, specifically so that the player would now be transported to the next level once they hit it, but I still need to test if it works once I fix QT. I hope to implement this to the main code on Git by the end of this week and to begin working on specific scenes such as 'you died/won' messages.
