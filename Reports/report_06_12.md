#  Report for the week of December 6th 2021


# Teams:

###Run team





Marie: This week I almost completed the Collision header and class. Some tests need to be completed but the player should now be able to stand on platforms and interact with objects. I also recoded for constant motion in x-direction. This week i hope to work on developing further the player-object interactions.


Fiona: This week, I worked on optimizing the map I have created last week for the 'Run' part of our project. I also coded a class of obstacles which will be either deadly or slow the player down when the player touches them. They appear on the screen an any position we want to give them. 
We will also be able to use them as exit objects (to signal the end of the level)

This week I worked on merging the codes of the two sections and di not finalize it, but will work on doing that this upcoming week. I further worked on developing some of the functions I was in charge of, such as the inventory and items, but did not finalize them as I want to be able to implement them into the merged code which is not finalized yet. Once the merge is finalized though, all of this should be relatively feasible.
