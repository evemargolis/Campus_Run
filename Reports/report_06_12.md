This week I worked on merging the codes of the two sections and di not finalize it, but will work on doing that this upcoming week. I further worked on developing some of the functions I was in charge of, such as the inventory and items, but did not finalize them as I want to be able to implement them into the merged code which is not finalized yet. Once the merge is finalized though, all of this should be relatively feasible.
