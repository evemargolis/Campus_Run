Antonina: This week, I worked on researching Godot for mac, such as downloading the necessary libraries and folders to be able to code in cpp using Godot. Unfortunately, we found that we would be unable to use Godot for the project as it wasn't a feasible option for everyone, so I switched my focus to downloading a virtual machine and checking that I would be able to run Windows on my computer. It isn't the fastest option, but it will hopefully allow me to run the code on my system and begin coding. I also did more research on switching between screens/maps for the game itself.
