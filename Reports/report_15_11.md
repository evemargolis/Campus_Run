###UI design

Antonina: This week, I worked on researching Godot for mac, such as downloading the necessary libraries and folders to be able to code in cpp using Godot. Unfortunately, we found that we would be unable to use Godot for the project as it wasn't a feasible option for everyone, so I switched my focus to downloading a virtual machine and checking that I would be able to run Windows on my computer. It isn't the fastest option, but it will hopefully allow me to run the code on my system and begin coding. I also did more research on switching between screens/maps for the game itself.

Eve Margolis:
This week, I solved slight issues I had with the coin counter we wished to implement.I also started working on the pause menu, and created a few new classes about the game state. I will aim to finish this next week and further develop the project implementation.


Rojin Radmehr:

This week, since we had problems with mac computers, i spend some time searching for a solution and then spend the rest of the week trying to understand gadot.
Next week I will help implement the first level of the game.
