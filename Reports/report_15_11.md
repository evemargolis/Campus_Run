###UI design

Marie: This week, we continued to try to get a software to work with our computers to allow us to visualise the game. We tried cmake and Godot. We decided that Godot was incompatible with our objectives. I also started furthering the work done last week for the camera (particularly making sure that it followed the player) with Antoine. Next week, I hope to have completed the camera and the problem with the compatibility of iOS with the programs we intend on using to develop our game.
