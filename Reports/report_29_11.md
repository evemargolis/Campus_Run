###UI design




Marie:This week, I coded the Collision header and class. These will be utilised to detect player and object interactions and allow us to assign particular actions depending on the object the player is colliding with (i.e. die or be pushed back or slowed down ect.). Next week, I aim to complete this class and be able to apply it to 3 different object types.



Fiona: This week, I coded a map for the 'run' part of the game by writing the Tile and Tilemap classes. They work and we can now have a ground and platforms. I also started working on obstacles. The structure is there but the code doesn't work yet. I will keep working on this issue and solve it before the next TD session

Antonina: This week, I coded the classes Scene and SceneState, which will allow us to switch between levels and menus, but I haven't committed them to the main code yet as I had some issues opening it on my computer. Next week, I will begin working introducing a new feature to the tiles which "teleports" the player when they cross it, allowing us to use player position/action to switch between levels.
