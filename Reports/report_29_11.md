###UI design

Fiona: This week, I coded a map for the 'run' part of the game by writing the Tile and Tilemap classes. They work and we can now have a ground and platforms. I also started working on obstacles. The structure is there but the code doesn't work yet. I will keep working on this issue and solve it before the next TD session

Eve Margolis:

This week I spent most of the TD section trying to 'clean' the code we have so as to make sure we were not implementing superficial elements. I then worked more on the inventory for the character which should theoretically be transferable for all the levels, as well as implemented a double jump feature. I will continue working on items of our first level next week as well as focus on implementing the additional interesting aspects to make it more complete.
