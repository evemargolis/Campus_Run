Fiona: This week, I stopped working on the map I had created using Cmake on my mac and worked on Windows with Eve to continue building the map she had started and finish it. We created types of Tiles to have killing objects and flags, we used a text file system to make the map efficient and the map building easier. We then wrote the file representing the map by giving each tile a position, type, texture, and collision boolean.
